                                            ## Security Frameworks
# Security frameworks are documented processes that define policies and procedures organisations should follow to establish and manage security controls. 
# They are blueprints for identifying and managing the risks they may face and the weaknesses in place that may lead to an attack.


                                         ## NIST Cybersecurity Framework
# The Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and it provides detailed guidance for organisations to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk.
# The framework focuses on five essential functions: Identify -> Protect -> Detect -> Respond -> Recover.
# With these functions, the framework allows organisations to prioritise their cybersecurity investments and engage in continuous improvement towards a target cybersecurity profile. 

                                        ## ISO 27000 Series
# The International Organization of Standardization (ISO) develops a series of frameworks for different industries and sectors. 
# The ISO 27001 and 27002 standards are commonly known for cybersecurity and outline the requirements and procedures for creating, implementing and managing an information security management system (ISMS)



                                        ## MITRE ATT&CK Framework
# Identifying adversary plans of attack can be challenging to embark on blindly.
# They can be understood through the behaviours, methods, tools and strategies established for an attack, commonly known as Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)
# The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a knowledge base of TTPs, carefully curated and detailed to ensure security teams can identify attack patterns.
# The frameworkâ€™s structure is similar to a periodic table, mapping techniques against phases of the attack chain and referencing system platforms exploited. 


                                      ## Cyber Kill Chain
# A key concept of this framework was adopted from the military with the terminology kill chain, which describes the structure of an attack and consists of target identification, decision and order to attack the target, and finally, target destruction.
# Developed by Lockheed Martin, the cyber kill chain describes the stages commonly followed by cyber attacks and security defenders can use the framework as part of intelligence-driven defence.


                                       ## Unified Kill Chain
# The Unified Kill Chain can be described as the unification of the MITRE ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain frameworks.
# The Unified Kill Chain describes 18 phases of attack based on Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)
