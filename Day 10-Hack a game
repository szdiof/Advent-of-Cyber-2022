                                                      ## The Memory of a Program
                                                      
# Whenever we execute a program, all data will be processed somehow through the computer's RAM (Random Access Memory). 
# If you think of a videogame, your HP, position, movement speed and direction are all stored somewhere in memory and updated as needed as the game goes. 
# If you can modify the relevant memory positions, you could trick the game into thinking you have more HP than you should or even a higher score! This sounds relatively easy, but a program's memory space is vast and sparse, and finding the location where these variables are stored is nothing you'd want to do by hand. 
# Hopefully, some tools will help us navigate memory and find where all the juicy information is at.
# All you need for this challenge is available in the deployable machine. If you prefer to do so, however, you can download and install Cetus on your own machine by downloading it from here.

                                                        ## The Mighty Cetus
# Cetus is a simple browser plugin that works for Firefox and Chrome, allowin
g you to explore the memory space of Web Assembly games that run in your browser. 
# The main idea behind it is to provide you with the tools to easily find any piece of data stored in memory and modify it if needed.
# On top of that, it will let you modify a game's compiled code and alter its behaviours if you want, although we won't need to go that deep for this task.


                                              ## Installing Cetus on Firefox 
                                              
# To run Cetus on Firefox, you will need to load it as a temporary extension since it isn't available on the add-ons website.
# To do this, open Firefox and type about:debugging in the address bar. 
# Once in there, go to This Firefox, where you'll find a button to load temporary add-ons. 
# Temporary add-ons will only be loaded for as long as the browser remains open, so you'll need to load it again if you close it for some reason:
# To load the extension, you will need to browse to the directory where you downloaded and extracted Cetus and select the manifest.json file inside the main folder and click OK:

                                          
                                              ## Installing Cetus on Chrome
                                              
# To install Cetus on Chrome, type chrome://extensions in your address bar.
# This will take you to the extensions manager.
# You will need to enable the Developer mode, enabling additional buttons to load the extension.
# Click the Load unpacked button and point to the directory where you uncompressed the plugin.
# Once you are done, you should see Cetus loaded in your extensions:
