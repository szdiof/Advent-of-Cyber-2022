                                                      ## Packets and Packet Analysis?
                                                      
# Packets are the most basic unit of the network data transferred over the network. 
# When a message is sent from one host to another, it is transmitted in small chunks; each called a packet. 
# Packet analysis is the process of extracting, assessing and identifying network patterns such as connections, shares, commands and other network activities, like logins, and system failures, from the prerecorded traffic files.    


                                                      ## Why Does Packet Analysis Still Matter?
                                                      
# Network traffic is a pure and rich data source. A Packet Capture (PCAP) of network events provides a rich data source for analysis.
# Capturing live data can be focused on traffic flow, which only provides statistics on the network traffic.
# On the other hand, identifying and investigating network patterns in-depth is done at the packet level. Consequently, threat detection and real-time performance troubleshooting cannot be done without packet analysis.
# Today, most network-based detection mechanisms and notification systems ingest and parse packet-level information to create alerts and statistical data.
# Also, most red/blue/purple teaming exercises are optimised with packet-level analysis.
# Lastly, even encoded/encrypted network data still provides value by pointing to an odd, weird, or unexpected pattern or situation, highlighting that packet analysis still matters.


                                              ## Points to consider when working with PCAPs
                                              
# There are various points to consider before conducting packet analysis. The essential points are listed below.

1. Network and standard protocols knowledge. --> Knowledge of the network and protocol operations is a must. An analyst must know how the protocols work and which protocol provides particular information that needs to be used for analysis. Also, knowing the "normal" and "abnormal" behaviours and patterns is a big plus! 
2. Familiarity with attack and defence concepts. --> You can't detect what you don't know. An analyst must know "how the attacks are conducted" to identify "what is happening" and decide "where to look".
3. Practical experience in analysis tools. --> You can't burn down the haystack to find a needle! An analyst must know how to use the tools to extract particular information from packet bytes.


                                            ## What is Wireshark and How to Use It?
                                            
# Wireshark is an industry-standard tool for network protocol analysis and is essential in any traffic and packet investigation. You can view, save and break down the network traffic with it. You can learn more about Wireshark by completing the Wireshark module().
# After opening a pcap file for the first time, it might look daunting to decide where to focus. 
--> Breaking down all the packets in a tree-based view will make the analysis easier.
--> Statistics will show the overall usage of the ports and services, so it will be slightly easier to see the big picture in the capture file.

<>  Use the "Statistics --> Protocol Hierarchy" menu to view the overall usage of the ports and services.

Now, look at the output. The majority of the traffic is on TCP and HTTP: 



<> You can also view the connections by IP and TCP/UDP protocols to view the overall usage of the ports and services (including the total packet numbers transferred over a particular port and between two hosts). 
---> The next step is viewing the IP conversations to spot if there is a weird/suspicious/not usual IP address in use.

# Close the protocol hierarchy window, use the "Statistics --> Conversations" section and navigate to the IPv4 section to view the list of IP conversations. 

Note: Navigate to the TCP/UDP sections to view the TCP/UDP conversation details.

<> Now we have a detailed list of the IP addresses, port numbers, and the number of packets transferred from one endpoint to another. This information will help us identify suspicious IP addresses, connections and ports.
# Let's analyse the findings in this section; navigate to the TCP part and look at the results, the port 80 is used as a communication medium in TCP. Port 80 represents the HTTP service. Next, you can view that DNS service is also used by navigating to the UDP section

Checks to do

    Packet statistics
    Service identification
    IP reputation check
    
Questions to answer

    Which IP addresses are in use?
    Has a suspicious IP address been detected?
    Has suspicious port usage been detected?
    Which port numbers and services are in use?
    Is there an abnormal level of traffic on any port or service?

Note: You can use the OSINT tools mentioned on Day 6 to conduct a reputation check on suspicious IP/domain addresses. Note that you can't rely on the reputation check if nothing suspicious is detected at this stage.You still need to go further to discover potential anomalies. Also, if you can't recall or identify the port numbers and service names, you can use the "Google Dorks" search techniques shown on Day 3 to search and learn port numbers and service names.

# Now let's focus on the HTTP and DNS. As a nature of these protocols, everything transferred over these protocols is cleartext. At this stage, filtering the DNS packets to view the interacted domains is a good start before deep diving into cleartext data.
------>  Close the statistics window, and type DNS in the search bar to apply a filter and view the DNS packets.

# DNS packets will help us to identify connected domain addresses to decide if they are affiliated with the suspicious threat and Bandit Yeti APT! Click on the first packet and use the lower left section of the tool (Packet Details Pane) to view the packet details. 
# There are multiple collapsed sections; click on the Domain Name System section to expand and view the DNS details of the packets.
# There are additional collapsed sections under the corresponding section; expand them to view all available details. You will find the interacted domain under the queries section.
