                                                            ## Threat Detection
                                                            
# Cyber threats and criminals have advanced tactics to ensure that they steal information and cause havoc. 
# As you have already seen through the previous days, there are many ways in which this can be done. 
# There are also ways for security teams to prepare their defences and identify these threats. 
# What would be evident is that most of the blue-team activities will require proactive approaches to analysing different logs, malware and network traffic. 
# This brings about the practice of threat detection.

<> Chopping Logs with Sigma Rules

# Sigma is an open-source generic signature language developed by Florian Roth & Thomas Patzke to describe log events in a structured format. 
# The format involves using a markup language called YAML, a designed syntax that allows for quick sharing of detection methods by security analysts. 
# The common factors to note about YAML files include the following:

    1.YAML is case-sensitive.
    2.Files should have the .yml extension.
    3.Spaces are used for indentation and not tabs.
    4.Comments are attributed using the # character.
    5.Key-value pairs are denoted using the colon : character.
    6.Array elements are denoted using the dash - character.
       
<> Sigma was developed to satisfy the following scenarios:

    1. To make detection methods and signatures shareable alongside IOCs and Yara rules.
    2. To write SIEM searches that avoid vendor lock-in.
    3. To share signatures with threat intelligence communities.
    4. To write custom detection rules for malicious behaviour based on specific conditions.
