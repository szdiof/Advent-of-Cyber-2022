                                                            ## What Are Log Files and Why Are They Useful
# Log files are files that contain historical records of events and other data from an application. Some common examples of events that you may find in a log file:

      Login attempts or failures
      Traffic on a network
      Things (website URLs, files, etc.) that have been accessed
      Password changes
      Application errors (used in debugging)
      and many, many more

# By making a historical record of events that have happened, log files are extremely important pieces of evidence when investigating:

    What has happened?
    When has it happened?
    Where has it happened?
    Who did it? Were they successful?
    What is the result of this action?
    

                                                    ## What Does a Log File Look Like?
                                                    
# Log files come in all shapes and sizes. However, a useful log will contain at least some of the following attributes:

1. A timestamp of the event (I.e. Date & Time)
2. The name of the service that is generating the logfile (I.e. SSH is a remote device management protocol that allows a user to login into a system remotely)
3. The actual event the service logs (i.e., in the event of a failed authentication, what credentials were tried, and by whom? (IP address)).

                                                  ## Common Locations of Log Files
<> Windows

# ﻿Windows features an in-built application that allows us to access historical records of events that happen. The Event Viewer.

1. Aplication                                          The service "tryhackme.exe" was restarted.
2. Security                                            User "cmnatic" successfully logged in.
3. Setup                                               The system must be restarted before "KB10134" can be installed.
4. System                                              The system unexpectedly shutdown due to power issues.


<> Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

# ﻿On this flavour of Linux, operating system log files (and often software-specific such as apache2) are located within the /var/log directory. 

# The following table highlights some important log files:

1. Authentication                               auth.log                    Failed password for root from 192.168.1.35 port 22 ssh2.

                                        ## Looking Through Log Files
# Log files can quickly contain many events and hundreds, if not thousands, of entries. The difficulty in analysing log files is separating useful information from useless.
# Tools such as Splunk are software solutions known as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is dedicated to aggregating logs for analysis. 


<> Advantage 
# SIEM platforms are dedicated services for log analysis.
# SIEM platforms can collect a wide variety of logs - from devices to networking equipment.
# SIEM platforms allow for advanced, in-depth analysis of many log files at once.

<> Disadvantage
# Commercial SIEM platforms are expensive to license and run.
# SIEM platforms take considerable time to properly set up and configure.
# SIEM platforms require training to be properly used.

## Luckily for us, most operating systems already come with a set of tools that allow us to search through log files. In this room, we will be using the grep command on Linux.

<> ﻿Grep 101
# Grep is a command dedicated to searching for a given text in a file. 
# Grep takes a given input (a text or value) and searches the entire file for any text that matches our input. 


    Option                       Example
1.   -i                          grep -i "helloworld" log.txt and grep -i "HELLOWORLD" log.txt will return the same matches.
2.   -E                          grep -E "thm|tryhackme" log.txt
3.   -i                          grep -r "helloworld" mydirectory
