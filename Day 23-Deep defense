								 ## Core Mindset
								 
# The core mindset that Defense in Depth is founded on is the idea that there is no such thing as a silver bullet that would defeat all of an organisation’s security woes. 
# No single defence mechanism can protect you from the bad world out there.		

								## Disrupting Adversarial Objectives
								
# Defense in Depth is mainly focused on disrupting adversarial objectives; that is, the shift of focus from ‘just’ securing the perimeter to securing everything in the path that the adversary will have to take from the perimeter to the crown jewels.

<> Let’s look at it at three varying levels of defense:

    1. The first level is having a focus on perimeter security. There are great prevention mechanisms present in the perimeter and essentially complete trust within it; thus, once the perimeter is bypassed, the organisation is pretty much at the mercy of the adversary.
    2. The second level has defensive layers in place; however, the emphasis is solely on prevention. It doesn’t leverage ‘knowing your environment’; even though adversarial objectives may be prevented to some degree, there’s a missed opportunity in terms of detection and consequently, alerting and response. Prevention is good, but the key to defeating the bad guys is having visibility into what they are doing.
    3. The third level has well-rounded defensive layers in place, leveraging the strategic application of sensors, effective creation of analytics, and efficient alerting and response capabilities of the security team. Preventative measures here are not only coupled by detection and alerting but also by immediate and efficient response.
    
# The first level above can be thought of as an organisation that employs great perimeter defenses in place, such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), Perimeter Network Firewalls, and even a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), but is yet to implement internal network security, and zero trust mechanisms are not yet in place.

# The second level can be thought of as an organisation that employs the first level of defenses but with more capable internal security measures, such as network segmentation, zero trust principle implementation, least privileged access principle implementation, and even hardened hosts and networks. Having this level is actually really good; however, forgetting that preventative appliances may be used for detective capabilities, too, is a wasted opportunity.

# The third level can be thought of as using the advantages of the first and second levels to ramp up the detection and response capability of the organisation via effective log collection and well-crafted analytics. This is where it goes full circle. We are not only expected to be good at layering preventive measures against attacks, but we should also be capable of responding to them if and when these defensive capabilities are bypassed.

# Remember that the main difference between levels 2 and 3 is the jiving together of these defensive layers and detection and response mechanisms, allowing for a coherent and well-rounded security posture.
