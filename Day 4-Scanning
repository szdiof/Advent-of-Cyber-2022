                                                      ## What is Scanning
                                                      
# Scanning is a set of procedures for identifying live hosts, ports, and services, discovering the operating system of the target system, and identifying vulnerabilities and threats in the network
# These scans are typically automated and give an insight into what could be exploited.
# Scanning reveals parts of the attack surface for attackers and allows launching targeted attacks to exploit the system.

                                                    ## Scanning Types
<> Passive Scanning:

# This method involves scanning a network without directly interacting with the target device (server, computer etc.).
# Passive scanning is usually carried out through packet capture and analysis tools like Wireshark; however, this technique only provides basic asset information like OS version, network protocol etc., against the target.

<> Active Scanning: 

# Active scanning is a scanning method whereby you scan individual endpoints in an IT network to retrieve more detailed information.
# The active scan involves sending packets or queries directly to specific assets rather than passively collecting that data by "catching" it in transit on the network's traffic.
# Active scanning is an immediate deep scan performed on targets to get detailed information. These targets can be a single endpoint or a network of endpoints.

                                                    ## Scanning Techniques
<> Network Scanning

# A network is usually a collection of interconnected hosts or computers to share information and resources.
# Network scanning helps to discover and map a complete network, including any live computer or hosts, open ports, IP addresses, and services running on any live host and operating system.
# Once the network is mapped, an attacker executes exploits as per the target system and services discovered.
# For example, a computer in a network with an outdated Apache version enables an attacker to launch an exploit against a vulnerable Apache server.

<> Port Scanning

# Per Wikipedia, "In computer networking, a port is a number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service. At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service".
# Port scanning is a conventional method to examine open ports in a network capable of receiving and sending data. 
# Port scanning is a conventional method to examine open ports in a network capable of receiving and sending data. 
# Port number varies between 0 to 65,536 based on the type of service running on the host. Port scanning results fall into the following three categories:

    Closed Ports: The host is not listening to the specific port.
    Open Ports: The host actively accepts a connection on the specific port.
    Filtered Ports: This indicates that the port is open; however, the host is not accepting connections or accepting connections as per certain criteria like specific source IP address.
    
<> Vulnerability Scanning

# The vulnerability scanning proactively identifies the network's vulnerabilities in an automated way that helps determine whether the system may be threatened or exploited.
# Free and paid tools are available that help to identify loopholes in a target system through a pre-build database of vulnerabilities. Pentesters widely use tools such as Nessus and Acunetix to identify loopholes in a system.

<> Scanning Tools

# Network Mapper (Nmap)
-----> Nmap is a popular tool used to carry out port scanning, discover network protocols, identify running services, and detect operating systems on live hosts.

# Type nmap in the AttackBox terminal.  A quick summary of important Nmap options is listed below:
------> TCP SYN Scan: Get the list of live hosts and associated ports on the hosts without completing the TCP three-way handshake and making the scan a little stealthier. Usage: nmap -sS 10.10.57.87
------> Ping Scan: Allows scanning the live hosts in the network without going deeper and checking for ports services etc. Usage: nmap -sn 10.10.57.87
------> Operating System Scan: Allows scanning of the type of OS running on a live host. Usage: nmap -O 10.10.57.87
-------> Detecting Services: Get a list of running services on a live host. Usage: nmap -sV 10.10.57.87

<> Nikto
# Nikto is open-source software that allows scanning websites for vulnerabilities. It enables looking for subdomains, outdated servers, debug messages etc., on a website. You can access it on the AttackBox by typing nikto -host 10.10.57.87

&& smb://10.10.57.87   OR smbclient //<hostname>/<sharename> -U <username>       -->  // Connect to samba
