                                          ## Remote Access Services
                                          
# You can easily control your computer system using the attached keyboard and mouse when you are at your computer.
# How can we manage a computer system that is physically in a different place? The computer might be in a separate room, building, or country.
# The need for remote administration of computer systems led to the development of various software packages and protocols. We will mention three examples:


   1.SSH
   2.RDP
   3.VNC

<> SSH stands for Secure Shell. It was initially used in Unix-like systems for remote login. It provides the user with a command-line interface (CLI) that can be used to execute commands.

<> RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol; it is also known as Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) or simply Remote Desktop (RD).
---->  It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to access an MS Windows system.
---->  When using Remote Desktop, the user can see their desktop and use the keyboard and mouse as if sitting at the computer.

<> VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing.
------> It provides access to a graphical interface which allows the user to view the desktop and (optionally) control the mouse and keyboard.
------> VNC is available for any system with a graphical interface, including MS Windows, Linux, and even macOS, Android and Raspberry Pi.

                                    ## Authentication
<> Authentication refers to the process where a system validates your identity. The process starts with the user claiming a specific unique identity, such as claiming to be the owner of a particular username. 

 1. Something you know refers, in general, to something you can memorize, such as a password or a PIN (Personal Identification Number).
 2. Something you have refers to something you own, hardware or software, such as a security token, a mobile phone, or a key file. The security token is a physical device that displays a number that changes periodically.
 3. Something you are refers to biometric authentication, such as when using a fingerprint reader or a retina scan.
 
 
                                              ## Attacking Passwords
# Passwords are the most commonly used authentication methods. Unfortunately, they are exposed to a variety of attacks. Some attacks don’t require any technical skills, such as shoulder surfing or password guessing. Other attacks require the use of automated tools.

  1. Shoulder Surfing: Looking over the victim’s shoulder might reveal the pattern they use to unlock their phone or the PIN code to use the ATM. This attack requires the least technical knowledge.
  2. Password Guessing: Without proper cyber security awareness, some users might be inclined to use personal details, such as birth date or daughter’s name, as these are easiest to remember.
  ----> Guessing the password of such users requires some knowledge of the target’s personal details; their birth year might end up as their ATM PIN code.
  3. Dictionary Attack: This approach expands on password guessing and attempts to include all valid words in a dictionary or a word list.
  4. Brute Force Attack: This attack is the most exhaustive and time-consuming, where an attacker can try all possible character combinations.
  
  
                                                      ## Hacking an Authentication Service
# hydra -l username -P wordlist.txt server service where we specify the following options:

---> -l username: -l should precede the username, i.e. the login name of the target. You should omit this option if the service does not use a username.
---> -P wordlist.txt: -P precedes the wordlist.txt file, which contains the list of passwords you want to try with the provided username.
---> server is the hostname or IP address of the target server.
---> service indicates the service in which you are trying to launch the dictionary attack.


Consider the following concrete examples:

hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt MACHINE_IP ssh

                    OR
hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://MACHINE_IP

# You can replace ssh with another protocol name, such as rdp, vnc, ftp, pop3 or any other protocol supported by Hydra.

There are some extra optional arguments that you can add:

 ----> -V or -vV, for verbose, makes Hydra show the username and password combinations being tried. This verbosity is very convenient to see the progress, especially if you still need to be more confident in your command-line syntax.
 ----> -d, for debugging, provides more detailed information about what’s happening. The debugging output can save you much frustration; for instance, if Hydra tries to connect to a closed port and timing out, -d will reveal this immediately.
 
 


                                          ## Connecting to a VNC Server
# Many clients can be used to connect to a VNC server. If you are connecting from the AttackBox, we recommend using Remmina. To start Remmina, from the Applications menu in the upper right, click on the Internet group to find Remmina.
# If you get a dialog box to unlock your login keyring, click Cancel.
# We need to select the VNC protocol and type the IP address of the target system, as shown in the figure below.
