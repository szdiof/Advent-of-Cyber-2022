                                                          ## What is Email Analysis?
# Email analysis is the process of extracting the email header information to expose the email file details.
# The email header contains the technical details of the email like sender, recipient, path, return address and attachments.
# Usually, these details are enough to determine if there is something suspicious/abnormal in the email and decide on further actions on the email, like filtering/quarantining or delivering.
# This process can be done manually and with the help of tools.

                                                        ## There are two main concerns in email analysis.
<> There are two main concerns in email analysis.

                    1. Security issues: Identifying suspicious/abnormal/malicious patterns in emails.
                    2. Performance issues: Identifying delivery and delay issues in emails.
                    
<> Before focusing on the hands-on email analysis, you will need to be familiar with the terms "social engineering" and "phishing".
 
 1. Social engineering: Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing or divulging information by exploiting weaknesses in human nature. These "weaknesses" can be curiosity, jealousy, greed, kindness, and willingness to help someone.
 2. Phishing: Phishing is a sub-section of social engineering delivered through email to trick someone into either revealing personal information and credentials or executing malicious code on their computer.
 
<> You can use Sublime Text to view email files without opening and executing any of the linked attachments/commands. You can view the email file in the text editor using two approaches.

          1. Right-click on the sample and open it with Sublime Text.
          2. Open Sublime Text and drag & drop the sample into the text editor.
          
# If your file has a ".eml" or ".msg" extension, the sublime text will automatically detect the structure and highlight the header fields for ease of readability.
# Note that if you are using a ".txt" or any other extension, you will need manually select the highlighting format by using the button located at the lower right corner.

<> Text editors are helpful in analysis, but there are some tools that can help you to view the email details in a clearer format. In this task, we will use the "emlAnalyzer" tool to view the body of the email and analyse the attachments.
<> The emlAnalyzer is a tool designed to parse email headers for a better view and analysis process.

3. -u                         Show URLs
4. --text                     Show cleartext data
5. --extract-all              Extract all attachments



<> Additionally, you can use some Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools to check email reputation and enrich the findings.
